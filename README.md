# champariz_game

Champariz is a drinking game playable with a deck of card. This app is made in the goal to substitute the deck of cards needed to play.

This app is developped with the framework Flutter. It's using the BloC pattern on top of the bloc package.

The main goal about this app is to learn how to use the BloC pattern and to dive deeper into Flutter. The app is not totally finished and i'm pretty sure that some bugs/and/or issues reside in the code.

## Rules of the game

The rules of this game are pretty simple : 
  - Same family : All players drink 3 sips
  - Pair : The player deals a number of sips equivalent to the value of the cards turned over.
  - 7 : The player finishes is drink
  - None of the above : The player drinks a number of sips equivalent to the subtraction of the value of the returned cards
